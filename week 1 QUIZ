It is important to learn how to read and search through the Python documentation. The answers to all of the questions in this quiz can be found within the official Python 3 documentation.

What module provides support for arithmetic on rational numbers?

Just give the name of the module (such as \color{red}{\verb!random!}random) with no spaces.

fractions
Correct
1 / 1 point
2.Question 2
What function could you use to create a complete copy of a nested dictionary (a dictionary that has dictionaries as values)?

If you think the answer is a builtin function just give the function name (such as \color{red}{\verb!int!}int) with no spaces, parentheses, or arguments.

If you think the answer is a function contained within a module, give the answer in the form \color{red}{\verb!module.function!}module.function with no other spaces, parentheses, or arguments.

copy.deepcopy
Correct
1 / 1 point
3.Question 3
What function would you use to open a web page in a new browser window from a Python program?

If you think the answer is a builtin function just give the function name (such as \color{red}{\verb!int!}int) with no spaces, parentheses, or arguments.

If you think the answer is a function contained within a module, give the answer in the form \color{red}{\verb!module.function!}module.function with no other spaces, parentheses, or arguments.

(If there are multiple functions that you could use, give only one.)

webbrowser.open
Correct

4.Question 4
What Python module allows you to read and write WAV audio files?

Just give the name of the module (such as \color{red}{\verb!random!}random) with no spaces.

wave
Correct
1 / 1 point
5.Question 5
What is the \color{red}{\verb!pickle!}pickle module?


A module that creates "pickle" objects. These pickle objects can be used to store data on disk.


A module that allows you to convert Python objects into the common PICKLE format used by many other languages which can then be transferred for use in programs written in those languages.


A module that allows you to convert Python objects into a byte stream and back. The "pickled" byte stream is suitable to be stored on disk or transferred over the network.


A module that can be used to generate cooking recipes, such as how to ferment cucumbers in a brine.

Correct
